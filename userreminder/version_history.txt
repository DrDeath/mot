	registrated_only_module.php, reminder_module.php, zeroposter_info.php, main_listener.php
-	Replaced the date formatting ( date('d.m.Y', "date") ) with $user->format_date("date') to present it in the current users notation in
	the files: registrated_only_module.php, reminder_module.php, settings_module.php, zeroposter_info.php
-	Corrected two incorrect date/time formattings with the email preview in settings_module.php
